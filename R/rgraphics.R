#' @name rgraphics
#' @title R Graphics for gridded data
#' @description Draw an image, perspective, contour or filled contour plot for data
#' on a bidimensional regular grid (S3 methods for class "\code{\link{data.grid}}").
#' @returns 
#' \code{image()} and \code{contour()} do not return any value, call for secondary 
#' effects (generate the corresponding plot).
#' \code{persp()} invisibly returns the viewing transformation matrix (see 
#' \code{\link{persp}} for details), a 4 x 4 matrix that can be used to superimpose 
#' additional graphical elements using the function \code{\link{trans3d}}. 
#' @seealso \code{\link{image}}, \code{\link{persp}}, \code{\link{contour}},
#' \code{\link{filled.contour}}, \code{\link{data.grid}}.
