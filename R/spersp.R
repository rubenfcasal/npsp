#' Perspective plot with a color scale
#'
#' \code{spersp} (generic function) draws a perspective plot of a surface over 
#' the \code{x-y} plane with the facets being filled with different colors 
#' and (optionally) adds a legend strip with the color scale 
#' (calls \code{\link{splot}} and \code{\link{persp}}). 
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{splot}}, \code{\link{spoints}}, \code{\link{simage}}, 
#' \code{\link{image}}, \code{\link[fields]{image.plot}}, \code{\link{data.grid}}, 
#' \code{\link{persp}}.
#' @section Side Effects: After exiting, the plotting region may be changed 
#' (\code{\link{par}("plt")}) to make it possible to add more features to the plot
#' (set \code{reset = FALSE} to avoid this).

# spersp S3 methods ----
#····································································
#' @rdname spersp  
#' @method spersp default
#' @param x grid values for \code{x} coordinate. If \code{x} is a list, 
#' its components \code{x$x} and \code{x$y} are used for \code{x}  
#' and \code{y}, respectively. If the list has component \code{z} this is used 
#' for \code{z}.
#' @param y grid values for \code{y} coordinate.
#' @param z matrix containing the values to be plotted (NAs are allowed).  
#' Note that \code{x} can be used instead of \code{z} for convenience.
#' @param s matrix containing the values used for coloring the facets. 
#' @param legend logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), the plotting region is splitted into two parts,
#' drawing the perspective plot in one and the legend with the color scale in the other.
#' If \code{FALSE} only the (coloured) perspective plot is drawn and the arguments related 
#' to the legend are ignored (\code{\link{splot}} is not called).
#' @param zlab label for the z axis, defaults to a description of \code{z}.
#' @param theta x-y rotation angle for perspective (azimuthal direction).
#' @param phi z-angle for perspective (colatitude). 	
#' @param ticktype character; \code{"simple"} draws just an arrow parallel to the axis 
#' to indicate direction of increase; \code{"detailed"} draws normal ticks as per 2D plots.
#' @param cex.axis magnification to be used for axis annotation (relative to the 
#' current setting of \code{\link{par}("cex")}).
#' @param ... additional graphical parameters (to be passed to \code{\link{persp}} 
#' or \code{spersp.default}; e.g. \code{xlim, ylim, zlim,} ...). NOTE:
#' graphical arguments passed here will only have impact on the main plot. 
#' To change the graphical defaults for the legend use the \code{\link{par}} 
#' function beforehand (e.g. \code{par(cex.lab = 2)} to increase colorbar labels). 
#' @return Invisibly returns a list with the following 4 components:
#' \item{pm}{the viewing transformation matrix (see \code{\link{persp}} for details), 
#' a 4 x 4 matrix that can be used to superimpose additional graphical elements 
#' using the function \code{\link{trans3d}}.} 
#' \item{bigplot}{plot coordinates of the main plot. These values may be useful for 
#' drawing a plot without the legend that is the same size as the plots with legends.}
#' \item{smallplot}{plot coordinates of the secondary plot (legend strip).}
#' \item{old.par}{previous graphical parameters (\code{par(old.par)} 
#' will reset plot parameters to the values before entering the function).}
